## Introduction

A easy and fundmental guide for new beginners of bioinformatics to conduct a bitter receptor search/report on animals.

This guidance mainly followed the instructions of former study(Jiao et al., Mol. Ecol., 2018; Jiao et al., Mol. Bio. Evol., 2021).

To be clear, this guidance is only about how to dig out the bitter receptor gene from a known genome which is not study yet. We human has tested bitter receptor from many animals, so if the genome was released before 2014, you may check if your interest bitter receptor family have been done.

My study is conducted on plateau zokor(Eospalax baileyi; Spalacidae, Rodentia). Bitter receptor of human, mouse and even mole rat was published and included on a bitter receptor database called BitterDB(Ziaikin et al., Nucl. Acids. Res., 2024, which I strongly advise you to take a look at it)

But it's not necessary for you to watch this guidance only if your sutdy species is also Rodentia or some related Order, it ok for all animals i think, because i follow the instructions that is used to conduct the search on bat.

Before we start, i suggest you to watch another brilliant work conducted by Hayakawa, it a wonderful work and we will use it to tell the whether the gene you found is orthologous genes or paralogous genes and the rules to name your new gene is written in this paper.

Have fun!


(and if there are any questions please leave the comment because i just do the identification yesterday, might make some mistakes)
